        <ul>
          <span class="fs-3">PROS:</span>
          <li> Low-maintenance: Hard courts are simple and inexpensive to maintain.
          </li>
          <li> Longevity: It is a long-lasting tennis court surface.
          </li>
          <li> Standard: Hard courts are a fairly neutral surface that accommodates all playing styles.
          </li>
          <li> Ideal bounce: There is no effect on the ball’s trajectory.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <span class="fs-3">CONS:</span>
          <li> Hard on the body: Strength and stamina are strongly advised.
          </li>
          <li> Hard court: Hard courts are not suitable for senior tennis players.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Hard courts are essential for aspiring professional players as the most common surface on the professional tennis
        tour. Physical stamina and resistance, combined with a good serve, can go a long way, so tailor your practice
        sessions accordingly.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">Clay Tennis Courts. <span class="text-body-secondary">It’ll blow
              your mind.</span></h2>

          <ul>
            <span class="fs-3"> PROS:
            </span>
            <li> Point construction: Clay courts are the best surface for learning how to construct a point properly.
            </li>
            <li> Durability: The tennis court surface with the longest lifespan.
            </li>
            <li> Improving: The best surface for tennis players to improve on.
            </li>
            <li> Fewer injuries: The least amount of stress on the body
            </li>
            <li> Fewer errors: The marks left by the ball make the judge’s job easier.
            </li>
            <li> Cost: Clay courts are less expensive to build.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <span class="fs-3">CONS:
            </span>
            <li> High upkeep: Brushing, watering, and rolling are all required.
            </li>
            <li> Weather conditions: Significant weather impact
            </li>
            <li> Defensive playing style: The balls bounce slowly and high, making them unsuitable for offensive players.
            </li>
          </ul>

        Although big serves lose their advantage and this surface is quite forgiving, some offensive players have won the
        French Grand Slam tournament. <br> However, successful players had to change their game style and strategy. <br>

        If you want to be a complete player, you should practice on clay courts. <br> The ability to adapt to each
        surface, on the other hand, is what distinguishes the good from the great.

          <ul><span class="fs-3"> PROS:</span>
          <li>        High-level tennis: Allows for quick and spectacular points
          </li>
          <li>        Less exhausting: Physically forgiving surface

          <li>        Service: A strong serve in tennis can be a valuable ally on grass courts.
          </li>
          <li>        Fewer injuries: gentle on the joints.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <ul><span class="fs-3">CONS:</span>
            <li>        Costliness: Building and maintenance are not cheap.
            </li>
            <li>        Weather: Wet areas will reduce the quality of the ball bounce.
            </li>
            <li>        Slippery when wet: If not completely dry, it can be slippery.
            </li>
        </ul>
          For amateur players, playing on grass courts is uncommon; however, if you have an upcoming tournament on this surface, try to get as much practice on it as possible beforehand. If I had to pick one thing to help you improve as a grass player, it would be to stay low and bend your knees more than usual.
